# ROS_human_detection
Human detection model that runs on ROS

This is a human detection mode that uses Intel RealSense D435 Camera and ROS Kinetic. Visit the GitHub page of
Intel RealSense-ROS for more camera installation.

Run the following commands on terminal to get started.

First we start a workspace
```shell
mkdir -p ~/catkin_workspace/src
cd catkin_workspace/src
```

Pull the repository and catkin_make
```shell
git clone https://github.com/SuperKuooo/ROS_human_detection.git
cd ..
catkin_make
source ./devel/setup.bash
```

*Something like that. I will fix it later.*
